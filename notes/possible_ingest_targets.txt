- all releases from small journals, regardless of OA status, if small (eg, less than 200 papers published), and not big5

more complex crawling/content:
- add video link to alternative content demo ingest: https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/48630/items/1.0400764
- watermark.silverchair.com: if terminal-bad-status, then do recrawl via heritrix with base_url
- www.morressier.com: interesting site for rich web crawling/preservation (video+slides+data)
- doi.ala.org.au: possible dataset ingest source
- peerj.com, at least reviews, should be HTML ingest? or are some PDF?
- publons.com should be HTML ingest, possibly special case for scope
- frontiersin.org: any 'component' releases with PDF file are probably a metadata bug

other tasks:
- handle this related withdrawn notice? https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/48630/items/1.0401512
- push/deploy sandcrawler changes
