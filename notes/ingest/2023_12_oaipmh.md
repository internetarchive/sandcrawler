# OAI-PMH 2023-10 List

We ran two OAI-PMH harvests this year:

* [2023-06-15](https://archive.org/details/oai_harvest_20230615) (279,718,040) (a)
* [2023-11-01](https://archive.org/details/oai_harvest_2023-11-01) (326,163,077) (b)

An increase by 46,445,037. (c)

Out of the first harvest, we created a somewhat deduplicated seed list of
38,362,590 - so about 13%. Given the same ratio holds, we may find about 6M
usable URLs in the the 46M new records.

Instead of the sandcrawler based workflow, we do a CDX check on the starting
URL and keep only the URLs for which we do not have any capture yet.

* [ ] get url list from a
* [ ] get url list from b
* [ ] calculate url list c = b - a
* [ ] run CDX lookup for c
* [ ] keep non-captured list of URLs as seedlist for crawl
