Simple internal-only web interface to help debug ingest issues.

- paste a hash, URL, or identifier and get a display of "everything we know" about it
- enter a URL/SURT prefix and get aggregate stats (?)
- enter a domain/host/prefix and get recent attempts/results
- pre-computed periodic reports on ingest pipeline (?)
